# `Ruka`
A general purpose, statically typed, programming language.

# ! In Early Development
`Ruka` is currently in the design stage, so the language has yet to be implemented, and everything is subject to drastic change.

# License
`Ruka` is distributed under the terms of both the MIT license and the Apache License (Version 2.0).

# Features
- Strong static typing
- Type inference
- First class Types, Errors, Functions, and Modules
- Shared functionality with interfaces called `Behaviours`
- Pattern matching
- Meta-programming with compile time execution
- Type reflection
- Green threads called `Strings`
- Reactivity with `Signals`
- Automatic memory management by default
    - Variables are stack or GC allocated based on usage
    - Can manually manage heap memory with allocators
- Per project language customization
    - Disable GC
    - Type inference customization
- References for when safety is a priority, Pointers for when it's not

# Stretch Goal: Silver
`Ruka` has an extension called `Silver`, which integrated `Ruka` and HDL for simple FPGA development

# Example: Linked List
```
const List = ($type: typeid): moduleid do
    return module {
        let max_size = 100

        const node = record {
            next: ?@this(),
            data: type
        }

        pub const t = record {
            head: ?node,
            size: uint
        }

        def insert[mut &t] = (value: type) {
            if (self.size == 0) {
                self.head = node {
                    next: null,
                    data: value
                }
                self.size++ 
            } else if (self.size <= max_size) {
                let tmp = self.head

                self.head = node {
                    next: tmp,
                    data: value
                }
                self.size++ 
            }
        }

        const set_max = (size: usize) |*| {
            max_size.* = size
        }
    }
end

let names = List(string).t{}

names.insert("foo")
names.insert("bar")
names.insert("foobar")
```
